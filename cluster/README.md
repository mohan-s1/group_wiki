To date (January 5, 2026), UVA has two supercomputing clusters, `Rivanna` and `Afton` with Afton being the newer one. The UVA Research Computing (RC) staff are generally great, and there are a couple things they do of note.

1. The most important one is they [answer support tickets](https://www.rc.virginia.edu/form/support-request/). You can submit a ticket to receive help with the caveat that the issue may be outside of what they can or have to assist you with.
  Note. If you are not on Grounds, you must use a VPN to access the ticket submission page. If the link above does not work, use [this one](https://www.rc.virginia.edu/support/) and choose `Open a Support Ticket`.
2. The UVA RC staff hold office hours where you can go an directly ask questions to the staff: scroll down [here](https://www.rc.virginia.edu/support/) to the `Office Hours` section.
3. The UVA RC staff hold workhops including a weekly Intro to HPC session: [https://www.rc.virginia.edu/education/workshops/](https://www.rc.virginia.edu/education/workshops/)
